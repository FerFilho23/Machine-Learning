# ðŸ“˜ Module 1 â€” Introduction to Machine Learning

This module introduces the **fundamentals of Machine Learning** and sets up the foundation for the rest of my studies. It covers the machine learning workflow, the CRISP-DM methodology, environment setup, and the basics of core Python libraries used for ML (NumPy, Pandas, Linear Algebra).

## ðŸ”¹ Contents

### 1. Foundations
- [Environment Setup](./env-setup.md)  
  Instructions for setting up a Python 3.11 environment with Conda, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Jupyter.

- [CRISP-DM: A Framework for ML Projects](./CRISP-DM.md)  
  Overview of the **six phases of CRISP-DM** (Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, Deployment) with examples from spam detection.  

- [Model Selection](./model-selection.md)  
  Explanation of the **model selection process**: Train/Validation/Test splits, avoiding the multiple comparisons problem, and ensuring robust performance evaluation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Learnings
- ML projects need **process and structure** â†’ CRISP-DM provides a robust framework.  
- Model selection is more than fitting algorithms â†’ requires **careful evaluation on unseen data**.  
- Building a reproducible **environment** ensures consistency in experiments.  
- NumPy, Pandas, and Linear Algebra are the **essential building blocks** for all ML workflows.
