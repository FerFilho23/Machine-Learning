## 📝 Summary  

Building good ML models usually requires **large amounts of high-quality training data**.  
If you don’t have access to such data, **pre-trained APIs** provide a way to use powerful AI capabilities instantly without building your own models.  

Think of APIs as **electric sockets**: you just “plug in” without worrying about how the system behind the wall works.  

Google Cloud provides **pre-trained APIs as services** that:  
- Save time and cost by removing the need to curate and train datasets.  
- Serve as **building blocks** for AI-powered applications.  
- Can be directly integrated into code to deliver predictions.
