# 📘 Model Tuning on Google Cloud  

## 🎯 Learning Objectives  

- Understand the concept and purpose of **model tuning** for generative AI models.  
- Learn the different tuning methods: **adapter (supervised)**, **reinforcement (unsupervised)**, and **distillation**.  
- Explore **parameter-efficient tuning** as an alternative to full fine-tuning.  
- Learn how to **launch and monitor a tuning job** in **Vertex AI Studio**.

## 📝 Summary  

After mastering **prompt design**, model tuning represents the next step toward **customizing and optimizing generative AI models**.  
While prompt design allows natural-language-level control, **model tuning** modifies the model’s internal behavior and domain specialization through **additional training** on your data.

Tuning allows you to:  

- Improve model performance for **specific industries or tasks**.  
- Reduce response variability and inconsistency.  
- Adapt a general-purpose model to **domain-specific language** or tone.

## ⚙️ Types of Model Tuning  

### 🔹 1. Prompt Design (No-Code Approach)  

- Uses **instructions, examples, and context** to guide model responses.  
- Does **not** change model parameters — only influences how the model responds.  
- Advantages: fast, easy to iterate, requires no ML expertise.  
- Limitations: unpredictable results; limited context size; inconsistent behavior over time.

### 🔹 2. Parameter-Efficient Tuning (PET)  

Large models have **billions of parameters**, making full fine-tuning impractical.  
PET focuses on adjusting **a small subset of parameters** to achieve domain-specific improvements **efficiently**.

This family of techniques provides strong results with minimal compute cost and data volume.

#### Key Variants

| **Tuning Type** | **Supervision** | **Description** | **Typical Use Case** |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Adapter Tuning** | Supervised | Adds small layers (“adapters”) between existing layers to learn new tasks using limited examples. | When you have ~100 labeled samples and want faster convergence. |
| **Reinforcement Tuning (RLHF)** | Unsupervised | Uses **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback** to iteratively improve responses. | When user feedback or preference data is available. |
| **Distillation** | Semi-Supervised | Transfers knowledge from a **large teacher model** to a **smaller student model** to reduce cost and latency. | When deploying compact, efficient models for production use. |

## 🧠 Distillation: The Google Cloud Edge  

**Model distillation** is a **Google-exclusive tuning technique** available via **Vertex AI**.  
It allows you to:  

- Train smaller, faster, task-specific models.  
- Maintain strong accuracy with **reduced cost and latency**.  
- Improve model **reasoning** by incorporating **rationales** (explanations) from a larger “teacher” model.  

> **Analogy:** Like a student learning from a professor — the smaller model inherits both knowledge and reasoning from the larger one.  

Distillation produces **student models** that are more efficient for real-world applications and edge deployments.

## 🧩 Launching a Tuning Job in Vertex AI Studio  

You can create and manage tuning jobs directly in **Vertex AI Studio** via the **Tune and Distill** interface.  

### Steps

1. **Navigate to:**  
   `Vertex AI Studio → Language → Tune and Distill → Create Tuned Model`

2. **Choose Tuning Method:**  
   - **Supervised Tuning (Adapter)**  
   - **Unsupervised Tuning (Reinforcement)**  

3. **Configure Model Details:**  
   - **Model Name:** Choose a meaningful name.  
   - **Base Model:** Select the foundation model (e.g., Gemini, Codey, Gemma).  
   - **Region & Output Directory:** Specify the storage location.  

4. **Upload Training Data:**  
   - Training data must be stored in **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**.  
   - Dataset format: **JSONL** (JSON Lines), structured as key-value pairs.
   - Recommended: ~100 examples for optimal performance (minimum 10).

5. **Start and Monitor the Job:**
    - Launch tuning from the Studio UI.
    - Track progress and logs in the Google Cloud Console.
    - On completion, the tuned model appears in the Vertex AI Model Registry.

6. **Deploy or Test the Model:**
    - Deploy to an endpoint for real-time serving.
    - Test interactively within Vertex AI Studio.

## 💡 Key Insights

- Prompt design influences output style; model tuning transforms model behavior.

- Parameter-efficient tuning enables specialization with minimal compute and data.

- Adapter tuning is ideal for rapid, small-scale fine-tuning (~100 examples).
